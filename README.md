  ### Description:

  - Personal portfolio built using React. This is a single-page application which consists of a homepage, about me page, projects, contact, and resume page. All pages are accessed using React.dom.router - meaning it remains a single-page application. All projects in the portfolio page have active links to both repo's and live sites
