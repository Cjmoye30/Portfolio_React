        aboutMe: 'After having the fortune of playing professional affiliated baseball and spending over six years in the Supply Chain Industry, I began to notice a growing void in my life. It reached a point where it felt as though I was not creating, and consequently, I was not experiencing personal growth. Therefore, in the winter of 2022, I made the pivotal decision to take a leap of faith and embark on a journey to become a Full-Stack Web Developer, seeking to rediscover purpose in my life. Since making that choice, I have never looked back, and I am confident that I am moving in the right direction. Although my time as a professional athlete may be behind me, my determination to continually challenge myself remains steadfast',
